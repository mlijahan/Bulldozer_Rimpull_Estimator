# Bulldozer_rimpull


One of the most important factors that impressed on productivity of bulldozer is available rimpull. In this project, user inserts some inputs to take the rimpull of an specific machine model in deppendent on job site conditions (hauling material density, slop of the hauling road, and fraction between tires or tracks and ground.

Available rimpull could not be lesser than total resistance.

Rimpull is a term used to designate the tractive force between the tires of a machineâ€™s driving wheels and the surface on which they travel. If the coefficient of traction is sufficiently high, no tire slippage will occur, in which case maximum rimpull is a function of the power of the engine and the gear ratios between the engine and the driving wheels.

Rimpull (lb) = (375* hp * efficiency) /speed (mph)

efficiency = The efficiency of most tractors and trucks will range from 0.80 to 0.85. SAE recommends using 0.85 when the efficiency is not known
hp = Manufacturers rate machine horsepower as either gross or flywheel (sometimes listed as net horsepower)
speed = different speeds according to different gears

Maximum rimpull will change due to slop and fraction of tire or track of the bulldozers with the road. Therefore we need to estimate available rimpull of equipment.
